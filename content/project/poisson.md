This summer project was an intensive application of the concepts learned in the earlier n-body simulation project.

The aim was to create a multi-grid solver for the Poissonâ€™s equation. The project was supervised by professor M.K. Verma. The existing serial code was changed into parallel approach to get the three dimension grid of unknown values in a Jacobian iterator method. The reason was the same that a parallel approach using GPUs could provide much greater computational speeds.

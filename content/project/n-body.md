The project was mainly aimed at providing an introduction to parallel computing rather than designing an application. The basics and the core concepts of parallel computing were studied from a mooc at UDACITY. After the semester long learning we decided to create a simulator of n-body particles.

In physics, the n-body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. The code was written in C++ and ran on CUDA (a parallel computing platform provided by NVIDIA) to increase the computational efficency which resulted in a great boosting compared to serial version of same code. The visualisation part was done on openCV.


The project provided a great insight into the GPU hardware and the domain of parallel computing.

Below is the GitHub link for the repository of the code. Feel Free to contact me to know more.
